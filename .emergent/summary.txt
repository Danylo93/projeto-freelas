The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack service application, navigating numerous technical challenges. The project involved setting up an Expo (React Native/TypeScript) frontend and a FastAPI (Python/MongoDB) backend with Socket.io for real-time features. Early hurdles included  incompatibility in the backend, persistent  navigation issues leading to blank screens, and  misconfigurations. The engineer adopted an iterative debugging approach, leveraging extensive logging, simplifying complex components, and manually validating API endpoints. Significant effort was dedicated to re-implementing and stabilizing the Socket.io integration and enhancing the UI/UX with animations and a profile screen. Currently, the primary focus is on resolving a Socket disconnected issue on the frontend, indicating a problem with the backend's Socket.io server configuration or interaction.

The user requested a mobile application and API for freelance services, akin to Uber but for services like plumbing or electrical work.

**Client Functionalities:**
- **Service Discovery:** View a list of service providers (e.g., plumber - R20.00 - 3km - offline), even if offline.
- **Service Request:** Select a provider to open a modal with their details, confirm or cancel the request.
- **Real-time Status:** Track service status in real-time (e.g., Aguarde prestador aceitar, Conectando você ao prestador).
- **Map Tracking:** After acceptance, view a map tracing the provider's route with real-time distance updates (Uber-like).
- **Service Completion:** Iniciar Serviço when near, then Validar com foto and Concluir serviço.
- **Feedback:** Serviço Concluído modal with star ratings and description input.

**Provider Functionalities:**
- **Offer List:** View a real-time list of available service requests from clients.
- **Client Details:** Select an offer to view client information (e.g., João dos Santos - 4km Ganho: R70.00 - Serviço: Encanamento Descrição: Minha pia quebrou precisa refazer o encanamento.).
- **Accept/Cancel:** Accept or cancel service offers.
- **Map Tracking:** After acceptance, view a map tracing the route to the client.

**Authentication:**
- Login and registration screens (mobile and API) for two user types: Client (userType 2) and Provider (userType 1).
- Clients can see all providers; providers only see clients who requested services.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- User authentication (login/registration) for both client and provider types is functional.
- The client interface displays a list of service providers, which are clickable to open a service request modal.
- The service request modal includes keyboard handling to prevent input fields from being covered.
- A user profile screen with animations and basic statistics has been implemented.
- Logout functionality with confirmation is integrated for both user types.
- The backend API supports user management, provider profiles, service creation, and request handling.
- Initial seed data populates the database with test clients and providers.
- Basic UI/UX enhancements, including an animated splash screen and loading indicators, have been added.
- Socket.io has been re-implemented for real-time communication but is currently reported as disconnected, affecting real-time updates for providers receiving requests and clients seeing request status.
- The application needs to prevent clients from repeatedly clicking solicitar after a request has been made.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main application entry point. Handles the initial splash screen, checks user authentication status via , and conditionally renders the client or provider home screen.
    -   **Changes**: Initially configured for Expo Router. Modified several times to fix splash screen transition logic (Chat 210, 259, 262) and streamline conditional rendering based on user type, moving away from complex nested router logic (Chat 168).

The AI engineer is currently addressing two critical issues:
1.  **Socket.io Disconnected**: The primary problem is that the  connection on the frontend is reported as disconnected. While manual API tests confirm that the backend endpoints for login and fetching providers are working, the real-time communication aspect of the application is failing. The engineer has previously implemented and re-implemented  and included visual indicators, but the connection remains unstable.
2.  **Preventing Multiple Clicks on Service Requests**: After a client submits a service request, the UI does not currently provide feedback (e.g., Solicitação enviada), potentially leading the client to click the confirmation button multiple times.

The engineer has just reviewed backend logs related to Socket.io to identify the root cause of the disconnection, but the logs primarily show successful HTTP requests rather than specific Socket.io connection errors. The next step is to directly examine the backend's Socket.io implementation to ensure it's correctly configured to accept frontend connections.

Investigate the backend  to ensure Socket.io is correctly initialized and listening for connections.
